\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix. Vectors will be coerced to matrix with \code{as.matrix} (if this is possible)}

\item{Y}{Numeric matrix. Vectors will be coerced to matrix with \code{as.matrix} (if this is possible)}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of joint PLS components. Must be positive!}

\item{nx}{Integer. Number of orthogonal components in \eqn{X}. Negative values are interpreted as 0}

\item{ny}{Integer. Number of orthogonal components in \eqn{Y}. Negative values are interpreted as 0}

\item{lambda_kcv}{Integer. Number of folds of CV}

\item{groupx}{Character. A vecter or character indicating group names of the variables. The order of group names must correspond to the order of the vairables in X.}

\item{groupy}{Character. A vecter or character indicating group names of the variables. The order of group names must correspond to the order of the vairables in Y.}

\item{keepx_seq}{Vector. A vector indicating how many groups to keep for CV in each of the joint component of X.}

\item{tol}{double. Threshold for power method iteration}

\item{max_iterations}{Integer, Maximum number of iterations for power method}

\item{keepy_gr}{Vector. A vector indicating how many groups to keep for CV in each of the joint component of Y.}

\value{
A list containing
   \item{x}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of groups to keep for each X-joint compoent. One standard error rule is applied}
   \item{y}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of groups to keep for each Y-joint compoent. One standard error rule is applied}
   \item{x_max}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of groups to keep for each X-joint compoent, without applying the one standard error rule}
   \item{y_max}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of groups to keep for each Y-joint compoent, without applying the one standard error rule}
